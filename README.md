Hello! This is the first project to earn the Responsive web-design from FreeCodeCamp.

It was so much fun doing it, unfortunately I didn't do it on my git set computer, so I the progress couldn't be tracked by git.

The project passed the codepen automated assesmen, so I'm now going to project number two.

Have good one!
